New features:
- Added some new feature / ability (3afd86c58d883970ddd236dc7c8a0d5c5a0d9e3)
  - If needed, additional explanation / context here

Behavior changes:
- An existing feature or function changed its behavior (e40dd711d748b6398611db97f54e1622ac008ae)
  - For example, different output to the user

Thanks to @ User1, @ User2, @ User3!
```

Also run the two find-and-replace regexes below for nice formatting:

To quickly annotate commit hashes, append the full hash in parantheses to each line and then run
this find-and-replace regex (VSCode flavor):
- Find: (?<!commit/)([0-9a-f]{7})([0-9a-f]{33})
- Replace: [$1](https://github.com/seraxis/lr2oraja-endlessdream/commit/$1$2)

To quickly make GitHub usernames into clickable links, prepend each username with @ and then run
this find-and-replace regex (VSCode flavor):
- Find: (?<=Thanks to.*)(?<!\[)@([a-z0-9]+)
- Replace: [@$1](https://github.com/$1)

- ImGui notifications (#74)

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a crash when launching borderless without a set monitor (31f81b8cf87094cda152387cca74a9de5002ee4d)
- Fixed several issues with loading osu files ([parser #2](https://github.com/seraxis/jbms-parser/pull/2))
- On Linux, fixed opening chart folders with F3, the broken new version download link,
  and the launcher becoming non-functional after starting the game (#98)

Known issues:
- [Linux] Certain skin fonts may only load partially due to incorrect letter case
  in their filenames. Can be manually resolved by renaming the offending files.
- [Linux] When loading configuration files created on Windows, skin settings will fail
  to transfer. Fix by replacing backslashes with forward slashes in the skin paths in
  saved skin settings in `config.json` and `config_player.json` in the player folder.
- [Linux + Nvidia] The game may crash when launching. Fix by launching the game with
  gamescope: `gamescope -w 2560 -h 1440 -f -r 120.0 lr2oraja-endlessdream`

Endless Dream is a community fork and drop-in replacement for [beatoraja](https://github.com/exch-bms2/beatoraja) that integrates quality of life patches and new features not present in the upstream version of the game.

Based on [LR2oraja](https://github.com/wcko87/lr2oraja), which is itself a fork with LR2 judges and gauges, Endless Dream aims to fix some of the outstanding issues with the upstream project while being a central place for modifications and extensions that may never be accepted by upstream.

### Key Features
* In-game song downloader
* Osu file support
* On the fly ratemods/freq
* Increased performance by using the latest graphics backends available to libgdx
* Faster Table Processing
* Compatible with beatoraja 0.8.8 installs
* Built in Mod Menu, accessible using **`F5` or `Insert`**

## Building from source
A JDK 17 **with javafx** is required to build and run. Consider using [liberica JDK](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-17-lts), ensure that you download `Package: Full JDK` to get the JavaFX version.

Clone this repository with submodules
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:seraxis/lr2oraja-endlessdream.git
```
Run the gradle wrapper for your operating system and specify your desired platform as a [gradle system property](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_system_properties)

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat core:shadowJar -Dplatform=windows
```
**Linux:**
```sh
./gradlew core:shadowJar -Dplatform=linux
```
**MacOS:**
```sh
./gradlew core:shadowJar -Dplatform=macos
```

> [!NOTE]
> For `arm` user: add -Darch=aarch64

This task will create a jar located in `dist/` that can be used with any working installation of the game.
### Testing changes
Use of an IDE, such as [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html), is recommended for working on Endless Dream.

The gradle `core:runShadow` task can be used to quickly test and debug changes made to the project.

Configure the `runDir` system property to point to a beatoraja install or leave blank to have it run in the assets folder

Click 'More Actions' next to the run configurations panel in the window bar, Edit the runShadow configuration, and add `-DrunDir="[FULL PATH TO RAJA INSTALL]"`

![Run box clearly shown in the edit configuration menu](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1409976036963385547/1418936266514235483/idea64_bmidlXWb16.png?ex=68cfeee0&is=68ce9d60&hm=344ce793bff0fc3cdc47cc2b1a1692ec3a119b50e698a77c9c305508c1c6854e&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=547&height=208)

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat core:runShadow -Dplatform=windows -DrunDir="C:\beatoraja0.8.8"
```

## Contributing
Please state the impact your changes will have on drop-in compatibility with an upstream beatoraja install.
